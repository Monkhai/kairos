# Needs clarification

- Creation in android is not correct ??
- Pressing a task item in list crashes the app ??
- if you repeatedly pause and resume a timer it will do nothing
- task deletion marks them as done
  - is this happening or should this happen?

# For OnBoarding

- card's swipability is not clear

# Ready to fix

- Add restart button to Task Selection Screen
- deleting tasks when done filter is false causes issues
